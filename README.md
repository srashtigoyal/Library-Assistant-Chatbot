Library Services Bot
An AI-powered library assistant that compresses book catalogs and borrowing policies to help users find information faster, with reduced computational and operational costs.

Features
Compressed Book Catalogs Converts large catalogs into compact summaries without losing essential metadata (title, author, genre, availability).

Policy Simplification Breaks down borrowing policies into short, clear, and user-friendly explanations.

Fast Resource Discovery Allows users to query books by title, topic, author, or keywords using semantic search.

Conversational Interface Users can interact naturally (e.g., “Can I borrow this book for 30 days?”).

Cost-Efficient Design Uses compression and embeddings to minimize storage, API usage, and compute costs.

How It Works
Library catalogs and policy documents are ingested.

Text is compressed and summarized using NLP techniques.

Semantic embeddings are generated for fast search.

A chatbot interface retrieves and explains relevant information in real time.
