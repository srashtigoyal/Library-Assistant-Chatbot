# Library Services Bot

An AI-powered library assistant that compresses book catalogs and borrowing policies to help users find information faster, with **reduced computational and operational costs**.

## Features

### 1. Compressed Book Catalogs
Converts large catalogs into compact summaries without losing essential metadata (title, author, genre, availability).

### 2. Policy Simplification
Breaks down borrowing policies into short, clear, and user-friendly explanations.

### 3. Fast Resource Discovery
Allows users to query books by title, topic, author, or keywords using **semantic search**.

### 4. Conversational Interface
Users can interact naturally (e.g., *"Can I borrow this book for 30 days?"*).

### 5. Cost-Efficient Design
Uses compression and embeddings to minimize storage, API usage, and compute costs.

## How It Works

1.  Library catalogs and policy documents are **ingested**.
2.  Text is **compressed and summarized** using NLP techniques.
3.  **Semantic embeddings** are generated for fast search.
4.  A **chatbot interface** retrieves and explains relevant information in real time.
